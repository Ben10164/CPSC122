Project 13 
A Calculator, Part II 
Goal
This project will give you practiced with C++ code reuse mechanisms (inheritance and composition), along with practice using a stack

Summary
Project 13 completes the calculator project.  Project 13, like Project 12,  creates a class called calc.  calc uses class stack which inherits from class list.  The files necessary for this assignment may be found in my GitHub repository at:
.../pauldepalma/CPSC122/G-Stacks/proj13

Task
Find calc.h in the .../pauldepalma/CPSC122/G-Stacks/proj13.  Write all of the functions in calc.cpp that you did not write as part of Project 12.  Test these functions using your own version of calcTest.cpp.  
In essence, write functions to:
transform an expression from infix to postfix
display a postfix expression
evaluate a postfix expression with data entered from the command line

Constraints
your program must compile using g++ and run under Linux
you may not change list.h, list.cpp, stack2.h, stack2.cpp.  You may include additional private functions in calc.h You may not add or modify member variables or functions already defined.

Submission
Submit:
calc.h, calc.cpp
