Project 15 
A Recursive Linked List

Executive Summary
Project 15 is a version of class List in which all of the traversals are to be done recursively.

What You Will Learn
Project 15 will give you practice writing realistic recursive functions

Task
Implement all of the functions found in my github repository at: .../CPSC122/I-Recursion/proj15/list.h/ and which are not already implemented in list.cpp. 

Write and test functions in the order in which they appear in list.cpp

Hint: I have defined a companion function to Print() in the private section of the .h file.  It is named â€œPrint(node* cur).  This function should give you a clue about how to implement the recursive functions specified in list.cpp.

Constraints
Your program must compile using g++ and run under Linux
You may add utility functions to the Private section of list.h.  You may not add member variables, public functions, or revise any of the functions already defined.
