Project 12 
A Calculator 
Goal
This project will give you practiced with C++ code reuse mechanisms (inheritance and composition), along with practice using a stack

Summary
Project 12 is the infrastructure for a calculator that can do the four arithmetic operations on integers.  Project 12 creates a class called calc.  calc uses class stack which inherits from class list.  The files necessary for this assignment may be found in my GitHub repository at:
.../pauldepalma/CPSC122/G-Stacks/proj12

Task
Find calc.h in the .../pauldepalma/CPSC122/G-Stacks/proj12.  Write all of the functions in calc.cpp.   Test these functions using calcTest.cpp.  

Constraints
your program must compile using g++ and run under Linux
you may not change list.h, list.cpp, stack2.h, stack2.cpp.  You may include additional private functions in calc.h You may not add or modify member variables or functions already defined.

Submission
Submit:
calc.h, calc.cpp
