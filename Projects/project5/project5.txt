Project 5
The Caesar Cipher

Goal
Develop skill with file i/o
Develop skill with command line arguments

Summary
Write a program that uses the Caesar cipher to encrypt/decrypt a file

Command Line Inputs 
Name of file containing original plain text, PTfile for reference below
Name of file containing cipher text, CTfile for reference below
Name of file containing decrypted cipher text, PTEfile for reference below
Name of file containing key, keyFile for reference below
Integer indicating mode of operation:
0 generate key and store in keyFile
1 encrypt contents of PTfile and store the result in CTfile
2 decrypt contents of CTfile and store the result in PTEfile

Output
One of: keyFile, PTfile, CTfile, PTEfile 

Usage
There are three possibilities:
Generate the key: ./a.out 0 keyFile 
Encrypt plaintext: ./a.out 1 keyFile PTfile CTfile
Decrypt ciphertext: ./a.out 2 keyFile CTfile, PTEfile

Other Requirements and Advice
The program file is named: project5.cpp
Program must follow class coding standards
No global variables
Do a git pull on my GitHub repository to get the latest version of the function, fileOpen, describe below
The program is decomposed such that the major work occurs outside of main()
The program has at least these functions:

/*
Description: Randomly generates an integer in the range: [1..25]
Input: none
Output: returns a randomly generated integer in the range [1..25]
*/
	int keyGen ()

	/*
Description: Encrypts an upper case alphabetic character using the Caesar cipher
Input: upper case alphabetic character, valid key
Returns: encrypted version of ch
	*/
	char encrypt (char ch, int key)

	/*
Description: Decrypts an upper case alphabetic character using the Caesar cipher
Input: upper case alphabetic character, valid key
Returns: decrypted version of input
	*/
	char decrypt (char ch, int key)

	/*
	Description: function opens a file
     	Input: file stream object reference, name of the file, mode of open
Output: input file name is opened. 
*/
void fileOpen(fstream&, string name, char mode)
//this function may be found in 7-openFileError.cpp and used without change
